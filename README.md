# rust-linear-regression
A terrible port of ex1 octave code from Coursera's Machine Learning course into Rust

This is a very very bad sample of Rust code, please don't use it for reference. It is my first attempt at doing something beyond the projects in the Rust book.

If you'd like to help me learn Rust please feel free to open an issue with critiques!
